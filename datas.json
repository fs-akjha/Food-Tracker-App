They are essentially working two jobs, something their employers do not always consider when they assign unforgiving schedules.\n\nIt is unfair to expect someone's best effort when their job has rigid hours, and their home life pulls them in all different directions. At Fleet Studio, we understand that parenthood is not a nine-to-five job. It's 24/7. Since we have always been a remote-first company, we let our employees manage their own schedules. Giving our team members the freedom to decide their working hours means they can sustain a healthy work-life balance.

When you've been working from home long as we have (over 13 years), you tend to move away from the phrases mentioned in this article by Harvard Business Review. These phrases frame meetings as unpleasant, which is a disservice to you and can be dismissive to your fellow employees. For folks still finding their remote work sealegs, we have some suggestions to keep you from falling back on cliched expressions. When choosing your words, we recommend you cut to the chase, don't use terms that make meetings seem like a bad thing, and give everyone who wishes to speak the space to do so, even if it means scheduling a separate discussion later on. Choosing the right words for the occasion has helped us run productive, focused meetings.\n\nWhat are some new phrases we can use to phase out the ones in this article? #virtualmeeting #zoom #companyculture #employees #leadership #workingfromhome #remotework \nhttps://bit.ly/3GmTHQd",

It never hurts to think about this end goal as long as they're willing to play the long game to get there. One of the five tactics The Economic Times suggested was an online-first approach (https://bit.ly/3r3O9U9).\n\nFleet Studio's work on e-commerce sites and tools, plus other examples of victories for brands like Glossier and Mamaearth, demonstrate the success of this approach. Plenty of successful non-unicorns begin with e-commerce and eventually move to brick and mortar after building a solid foundation.\n\nBesides helping growth before setting up a physical location, what are some other benefits to an online-first approach?\n#brickandmortar #ecommerce #unicornclub #onlineretail #branding #glossier #mamaearth",

Some of the key takeaways include:\n\n- A diverse team is a strong team: When employees with different work styles and backgrounds come together, they balance each other out. It's a good thing to have a laid-back Ringo to mellow out the opinionated Pauls and Johns of the group.\n\n- Deadlines don't hurt: By setting an attainable goal with a completion deadline, you can help your team focus in.\n\n- Passion for what you do is the best productivity hack: When all of your team members love their work, it's easier for them to \"Come Together\" to get the job done.\n\nIt's a great idea to look outside of our areas of expertise for fresh perspectives on leadership and teamwork.

Why recreate the wheel when someone else has done the hard work? The new cloud calls this knowledge reuse — you’re reusing what others have already learned, created, and proven. Knowledge reuse isn’t a bad thing — it helps you learn, get working code faster, and reduces your frustration.</p>\n<p>You can stand on the shoulders of giants and use their prior lessons learned to build new things of value. You should still follow some basic best practices to prevent bugs or safety issues from sneaking into your code when copying, so make sure you educate yourself before grabbing and pasting.
